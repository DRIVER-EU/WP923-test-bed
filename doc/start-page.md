# About the DRIVER+ project

![DRIVER+](img/driver-home-page.jpg)

Current and future challenges due to increasingly severe consequences of natural disasters and terrorist threats require the development and uptake of innovative solutions that are addressing the operational needs of practitioners dealing with Crisis Management. DRIVER+ \(Driving Innovation in Crisis Management for European Resilience\) is a FP7 Crisis Management demonstration project aiming at improving the way capability development and innovation management is tackled. DRIVER+ has three main objectives:

1. Develop a pan-European Test-bed for Crisis Management capability development:

   * Develop a common guidance methodology and tool \(supporting trials and the gathering of lessons learned
   * Develop an infrastructure to create relevant environments, for enabling the trialing of new solutions and to explore and share CM capabilities
   * Run trials in order to assess the value of solutions addressing specific needs using guidance and infrastructure
   * Ensure the sustainability of the pan-European Test-bed

2. Develop a well-balanced comprehensive Portfolio of Crisis Management Solutions:

   * Facilitate the usage of the portfolio of solutions
   * Ensure the sustainability of the portfolio of tools

3. Facilitate a shared understanding of Crisis Management across Europe:

   * Establish a common background
   * Cooperate with external partners in joint trials
   * Disseminate project results

In order to achieve these objectives, five sub-projects \(SPs\) have been established. **SP91 Project Management** is devoted to consortium level project management, and it is also in charge of the alignment of DRIVER+ with external initiatives on crisis management for the benefit of DR
