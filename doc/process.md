# Work-process used to come up with the Test-bed specifications

This chapter explains how we came up with the specs stated in this document:
-	Analysis of lessons learned from the old Driver
-	Detailing based on the high-over design as stated in the DOW
-	Use-case analysis and cutting up the envisioned design in sub-functions
-	Discuss practical (im)possibilities with the trial-owners and other end-users
-	Consultation with solutions coordinators and development partners
-	Market research of technologies already out there
-	Experience from custom-made and off-the-shelve developments and implementation projects conducted by the Test-bedâ€™s development partners
