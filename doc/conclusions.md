# 6.   Conclusions and way forward

Now that the Test-bed’s environment, its high-level use-cases and its components and their reasons of existence are described in the previous chapters, it is time to look ahead at the development and implementation of the Test-bed. This chapter looks back at the previous chapters to draw some general conclusions about the Test-bed and look ahead on the development, implementation and functional review of the Test-bed. In the third and final section, links between WP923 \(i.e. development and implementation of the Test-bed\) and other SPs and WPs are described. 

## 6.1   Overall feedback on the Test-bed’s requirements specifications

Chapter 4 describes the high-level use-cases in which the components must function. The description of the environment the Test-bed is used in and descriptions of the components provide the specifications that apply as a “must” \(i.e. a requirement\) or as a “should” \(i.e. not a hard requirement, but a wish that should be complied to as much as possible\). These musts and shoulds are essential for a Test-bed to be useful and valuable in the trials yet to come, being both the four Trials and Final Demo within the D+-project and future trials outside this project. 

This document does not describe how these requirements and wishes are to be fulfilled. Decisions on which technology is used to develop the components and why these off-the-shelve, innovative or newly created technologies are used, as well as choices made in the development of human-software interfaces are to be described in the reference implementation deliverables D923.21, D923.22 and D923.23.  

Whether the specifications documented in this deliverable are fully valid, complete and/or feasible is yet to be shown. Conclusions about this can only be drawn when the components are developed and used in Trials: the proof is in the pudding. It is deliberately not foreseen that at this moment these specifications are fully correct and complete and actually will never fully be. The environments the Test-bed is to be used in are different per location and are dynamic over time in every potential location: technologies change, opinions of users differ and experiences grow. This is the main reason this requirements specifications document is a living document, allowing change when experiences in using the Test-bed are gathered. The development of the components is also staged, to offer several versions in time with a growing level of maturity.
