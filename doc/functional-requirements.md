# Functional requirements and wishes

This chapter lists the set of user requirements (need-to-haves) and additional wishes (nice-to-haves). This list is based on an analysis of:
-	The aims of the Test-bed in Driver+
-	Trial owner needs and practical constraints
-	Experiences by project-partners in the old Driver-project and running tests/exercises outside this project
-	Needs/wishes for tooling during the development, testing, roll-out and support on the Test-bed
