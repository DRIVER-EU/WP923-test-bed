# Aims of the Test-bed in Driver+ and high-over functional design

## What the Test-bed should provide
- Allow setup of Trials for testing solutions and driving innovations in CM
- Creation of simulated situations to omit ethical and practical real world issues
- Standardization of Trial infrastructure, consisting of the physical infrastructure (buildings and such), the IT infrastructure (hardware & software) and user profiles of trial staff and participants

## High-level functional design
Divide between (1) Platform (the buildings and hardware), (2) Software and (3) Staff and Participants. Pictures in this paragraph are draft versions. 

Add for the Test-bedâ€™s Software the picture of the connection layers, trial management, evaluation, solutions side and simulators side and explain how this image was constructed. 

## High-level use-cases
The following high-level use-cases describe the workings of the complete Test-bed during the different phases of use. Note that developing and updating the Test-bed is left out of these phases of use. The use-cases are focused on how users operate components of the Test-bed. This section is intended to describe the coherent use of the complete test-bed and to further explain the functional design of the Test-bed. This section is not intended to detail each specific component. Therefore, the steps in the use-cases are described only on a very high-over level. 

### High-level use-case: Set-up of the test-bed

### High-level use-case: Scenario creation

### High-level use-case: Starting-up the Test-bed and training staff and participants

### High-level use-case: Running a Trial

### High-level use-case: Evaluating a Trial
